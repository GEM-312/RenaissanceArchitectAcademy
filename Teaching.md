## Swift Language

### Extension-Based Content Splitting — 2026-03-18

**The Concept:** When a single file grows too large (our 208 knowledge cards would be 4000+ lines), Swift extensions let you split content across multiple files while keeping the same type.

**Step by Step:**
1. Define the main enum/struct in one file (`KnowledgeCard.swift` — model + router)
2. Create extensions in separate files (`KnowledgeCardContentRome.swift`, `...Renaissance.swift`)
3. Each extension adds `static var` computed properties to the same enum
4. The compiler treats them as one type — no imports needed between files

**In Our Code:** `KnowledgeCardContent` is an enum in `KnowledgeCard.swift`. The Rome/Renaissance files use `extension KnowledgeCardContent { ... }` to add building card arrays. The router switch in the main file references them all seamlessly.

**Key Takeaway:** Extensions across files = unlimited content scaling without a 5000-line monster file. Same pattern used for `LessonContent` → `LessonContentRome` + `LessonContentRenaissance`.

### Guard Clauses & Silent Failures — 2026-03-17

**The Concept:** A `guard` statement exits early if a condition fails. But if it exits *silently* (no error, no log, no UI), the user sees nothing and thinks the app is broken.

**Step by Step:**
1. `guard` checks a condition — if it fails, executes the `else` block
2. If the `else` block just does `return`, the function exits with zero feedback
3. The user stares at a blank screen wondering what's wrong
4. Fix: the `else` block should ALWAYS do something visible — show a default message, log an error, or provide a fallback

**In Our Code:** `ForestMapView.swift:241` — the old code was `guard let bid = vm.activeBuildingId else { return }`. The forest guidance never showed because `activeBuildingId` was nil. Fixed by showing a generic "Tap a tree" message in the else block.

**Key Takeaway:** Never let a guard clause fail silently in UI code. If the user can see the screen, the guard's else block should show them *something*.

### Dismiss Overlays Before Showing New Ones — 2026-03-17

**The Concept:** When multiple overlays can appear in a ZStack, showing a new one without hiding the old creates visual stacking — guidance bubbles showing behind knowledge cards, etc.

**Step by Step:**
1. View has guidance bubble (z-index 50) + knowledge card overlay (z-index higher)
2. Player does action → knowledge card appears on top
3. Old guidance bubble is still visible behind the card
4. Fix: set `showGuidance = false` before showing any new overlay

**In Our Code:** `WorkshopMapView.swift` — added `showArrivalGuidance = false` to `dismissAllOverlays()`. Also added it to `showKnowledgeCardForStation()`, and similar dismissals in CityMapView, CraftingRoomMapView, ForestMapView.

**Key Takeaway:** In any view with layered overlays, always dismiss the previous layer before showing a new one. Create a `dismissAllOverlays()` helper and call it everywhere.

## Architecture & Patterns

### Root Cause vs Symptom Fixing — 2026-03-18

**The Concept:** When a state machine returns the wrong state, fixing the UI that reads it is a band-aid. Fix the computation layer first, then add safety nets in the display layer.

**Step by Step:**
1. `currentPhase()` only checked card completion → returned `.build` prematurely (cards done ≠ materials crafted)
2. CityMapView `.build` detected missing materials → sent player to Workshop
3. WorkshopMapView `.build` didn't check materials → sent player back to City
4. **Infinite loop** — neither view could resolve the contradiction
5. **Root fix:** Made `currentPhase()` stay at `.craft` until materials are ACTUALLY crafted, not just until cards are done
6. **Safety net:** Fixed guidance in all 3 views so even if phase is `.build`, they verify materials before routing

**In Our Code:** `BuildingProgress.swift:108-119` — new material check using `Building.requiredCraftedItems(for:)` keeps phase at `.craft` until `workshopState.craftedMaterials` has all required items.

**Key Takeaway:** Always fix the computation layer (state machine) first, then the display layer (guidance messages). A wrong state will always find new ways to cause bugs if you only patch the UI.

### Actionable Checklists — Navigate From Status to Action — 2026-03-18

**The Concept:** A static checklist that only shows "done/not done" is a UI dead end. Making incomplete items tappable turns the checklist into a navigation hub — the player sees what's missing AND can do it right there.

**Step by Step:**
1. Checklist shows requirements with checkmarks for completed items
2. Incomplete item (e.g., "Floor Plan") becomes a `Button` instead of a static `HStack`
3. Button fires a callback (`onBeginSketching`) that the parent view handles
4. Parent dismisses checklist, then presents the next activity (sketching challenge)

**In Our Code:** `BuildingChecklistView.swift:87-109` — the sketch row is now a tappable `Button` with blue "Begin Sketch >" text when incomplete. `CityMapView.swift:593-601` — `onBeginSketching` dismisses checklist then opens the sketching sheet.

**Key Takeaway:** Every "not yet done" item in a UI should tell the user HOW to do it. Callbacks bridge the gap between "showing status" and "enabling action."

### Two Card Systems = Two Bugs — 2026-03-17

**The Concept:** The forest had TWO card systems that were never connected — ScienceCards (old, 4 per tree, gates timber) and KnowledgeCards (new, 2 for Pantheon, gates phase progression). The phase system checked KnowledgeCards, but the forest only showed ScienceCards. Result: phase stuck on `.explore` forever.

**Step by Step:**
1. Player completes 8 ScienceCards (2 trees x 4) — local state only, not in BuildingProgress
2. Phase system checks `KnowledgeCardContent.cards(for: "Pantheon", in: .forest)` — finds 2 unfinished cards
3. Those 2 KnowledgeCards are never shown to the player in the forest
4. `currentPhase()` returns `.explore` forever
5. Guidance says "keep exploring" in an infinite loop

**In Our Code:** Fixed in `ForestMapView.swift` by ignoring the phase system for forest exit guidance and checking timber count directly instead.

**Key Takeaway:** When you have parallel systems tracking similar things (two card types), make sure the gating logic uses the system the player actually interacts with. Otherwise you create invisible walls.

### The Phase State Machine Pattern — 2026-03-17

**The Concept:** A State Machine has a finite set of states and rules for transitioning between them. In our game, each building progresses through 5 phases: Learn -> Collect -> Explore -> Craft -> Build.

**Step by Step:**
1. **Define states** — `BuildingPhase` enum with 5 cases, each mapping to an environment
2. **Compute current state** — `currentPhase()` checks which conditions are met and returns the first incomplete phase
3. **Detect transitions** — Each view tracks `lastCheckedPhase`. When the phase changes, it means the player just advanced
4. **React to transitions** — Show `PhaseCompleteOverlay` to celebrate and guide the player to the next environment

**In Our Code:** `BuildingProgress.swift:75` — `currentPhase()` is a *computed state*, not a stored one. It re-derives the phase from progress data every time. This means it's always correct even after app restart — no stale state bugs.

**Key Takeaway:** State machines make complex game logic predictable. Instead of checking dozens of conditions scattered across views, you check one phase value and each view only handles its own phase.

## Responsive Layout

### Size Classes & AdaptiveWidthModifier — 2026-03-18

**The Concept:** SwiftUI provides `@Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass)` to detect iPhone (`.compact`) vs iPad/Mac (`.regular`). Instead of hardcoding pixel sizes, compute them relative to screen width using GeometryReader or toggle between two presets.

**Step by Step:**
1. Read `horizontalSizeClass` from environment → derive `isLargeScreen` boolean
2. For maxWidth constraints: use `.adaptiveWidth(420)` — expands to `.infinity` on iPhone, stays 420pt on iPad
3. For padding: use `.adaptivePadding(.horizontal, regular: 40, compact: 16)` — one modifier replaces inline ternaries
4. For cards/grids: use computed properties (`var cardW: CGFloat { isLargeScreen ? 200 : 140 }`)
5. For layout changes: switch `HStack` → `VStack` on compact (`Group { if isLargeScreen { HStack { ... } } else { VStack { ... } } }`)

**In Our Code:** KnowledgeCardsOverlay flipped card was 560pt (overflows 375pt iPhone SE by 185pt). Now 340pt on compact. CharacterSelectView gender cards were 300pt each (624pt total) — now 160pt (332pt total). MaterialPuzzleView switches from HStack to VStack on compact.

**Key Takeaway:** One `@Environment` + computed properties = responsive across all Apple devices. SpriteKit scenes need no changes — the camera system handles all sizes automatically.

### AdaptivePaddingModifier Pattern — 2026-03-18

**The Concept:** When `padding(isLargeScreen ? 40 : 16)` repeats across dozens of files, extract into a ViewModifier that reads `horizontalSizeClass` internally, so callers don't need their own `@Environment`.

**Step by Step:**
1. `AdaptivePaddingModifier` takes edges, regular, and compact parameters
2. Reads `@Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass)` inside the modifier
3. Usage: `.adaptivePadding(.horizontal, regular: 40, compact: 16)`
4. Pair with `.adaptiveWidth()` for maxWidth constraints

**In Our Code:** Added to `RenaissanceTheme.swift` alongside `AdaptiveWidthModifier`. Used in ConstructionSequenceView, HintOverlayView, BuildingChecklistView.

**Key Takeaway:** One modifier call replaces two lines of Environment + ternary per file.
